# Project Summary
Elevator Optimization:
EDIT HERE! Your project seeks to create a system which will improve upon the current elevator system. If we think about an elevator as having a limited amount of trips/time, etc. and that people want to make use of this functionality, current elevator systems are poorly designed to take advantage of existing information. First, typically, people know what floor they wish to go to before they enter an elevator, and current systems do not take advantage of this information. There is another contraint or factor with elevators which needs to be considered: they face a "rush hour" effect (e.g., most ridership occurs during determinable times). Therefore, given elevator riding trends (most trips occur within preset time periods) and the fact that we can take advantage of rider information before they get onto the elevator, we can design a program that seeks to better optimize trips on an elevator by trying to identify/group riders going to similar floors. By placing riders in these groups onto the same elevator (as opposed to the current system where riders are more or less randomly allocated to elevators based on the time they arrived at the elevator bank), we can achieve an efficiency similar to a "carpool" for elevators.
